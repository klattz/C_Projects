### Challenge 2 ###

This challenge was to print out  1 - 100. The catch was any mutiples of 3 would be printed as fuzz, mutiples of 5 would be buzz.
Then lastly any mutiples of 3 & 5 would be fuzzbuzz.


Build via this command 
gcc fuzzBuzz.c -o <filename>

This is file is already compiled as "fuzzBuzz"
